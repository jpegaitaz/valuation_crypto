<b>Crypto Valuation & 
Sentiment Analysis Dash App</b>

<b>Overview</b>

The Crypto Valuation & Sentiment Analysis Dash App is a web-based application built using Dash, Flask, and CCXT to analyze cryptocurrencies based on market data, sentiment analysis, and velocity calculations. The app integrates data from CoinMarketCap, CCXT-supported exchanges, OpenAI GPT-4, and Reddit/Google Trends to provide users with real-time insights into cryptocurrency valuation and sentiment trends.

<b>Features</b>

- Real-time Crypto Data Retrieval: Fetches price, market cap, circulating supply, and trading volume data from CoinMarketCap.

- Multi-Exchange Volume Aggregation: Retrieves 24-hour trading volumes from multiple exchanges using CCXT.

- Velocity Calculation: Computes the annual trading volume and adjusts it based on sentiment analysis.

- Sentiment Analysis: Uses Reddit & Google Trends data to determine market sentiment for a cryptocurrency.

- AI-Powered Analysis: Utilizes OpenAI GPT-4 to provide an expert opinion on the crypto market conditions based on extracted metrics.

- DALL·E Image Generation: Creates an AI-generated crypto-themed image based on market sentiment and news.

- Interactive UI: Built with Dash for an intuitive user experience.

<b>Installation</b>

<u>Prerequisites</u>

- Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Install dependencies using:

pip install dash flask ccxt requests openai

- You will also need API keys for:

CoinMarketCap API (for price and market data)

OpenAI API (for AI-generated insights and DALL·E image generation)

- Setting Up API Keys

Use apikey.py file and add:

cmc_api = "YOUR_COINMARKETCAP_API_KEY"
openai_key = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
reddit = praw.Reddit(client_id=client_id, client_secret=client_secret, user_agent=user_agent)

<b>Usage</b>

1) Run the app using the command:

python app.py

2) Enter a cryptocurrency symbol (e.g., BTC, ETH, SOL) in the input field.

3) Click 'Analyze' to generate real-time metrics, sentiment analysis, and AI-powered insights.

4) View the AI-generated market analysis and image.

<b>API Rate Limits & Handling</b>

The app includes API rate-limiting protection using exponential backoff and response caching to reduce unnecessary API calls.

OpenAI API calls are cached for 5 minutes to prevent excessive requests.

<b>Future Enhancements</b>

Implement historical analysis with trend forecasting.

Add more data sources for sentiment analysis (e.g., Twitter, on-chain analytics).

Improve UI design for better visualization of market trends.
